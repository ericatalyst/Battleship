![Setting Ships](/app/assets/images/_setships.png)
Players receive dynamic feedback while setting ship positions. Ships placements that overlap with other ships or move off-board are marked in red.

![Battle Screen](/app/assets/images/_battlescreen.png)
During the game, each player can see their own game board and a display showing where they have already shot at their opponents. Utilizing shortpolling, the display will change depending on who has the active turn. Once their opponent's turn is over, the current player has the option to select row and column values and fire at the opponent's board.
